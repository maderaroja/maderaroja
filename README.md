## Hackathon Competitions

## Banff International Research Station, Career & Innovation Hub (BIRS CIH) Hackathon
  
Banff International Research Station, Career & Innovation Hub (BIRS CIH) Hackathon required participants to build a visualization dashboard over the course of 24hrs that provided insight into the Canadian and American legislative process. Their partner, IOTO International (http://www.ioto.ca), provided APIs to access the political data on their website. The difficulty and interest of the competition lie within the restricted time frame to employ the APIs to fetch the data from IOTO International's website. My team worked cohesively together to achieve 2nd place! Here is a link(https://github.com/maderaroja/BIRS_CIH_dashboard) to our solution .

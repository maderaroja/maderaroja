## Hackathon Competitions
---
## Banff International Research Station, Career & Innovation Hub (BIRS CIH) Hackathon
  
Banff International Research Station, Career & Innovation Hub (BIRS CIH) Hackathon required participants to build a visualization dashboard over the course of 24hrs that provided insight into the Canadian and American legislative process. Their partner, IOTO International (http://www.ioto.ca), provided APIs to access the political data on their website. The difficulty and interest of the competition lie within the restricted time frame to employ the APIs to fetch the data from IOTO International's website. My team worked cohesively together to achieve 2nd place! Here is a [link](https://github.com/maderaroja/BIRS_CIH_dashboard) to our solution.
  
## Hack The Globe (HTG)  
  
HTG is Canada's 1st multidisciplinary social impact hackathon that is open to participants from all over the world. Its aim is to "challenge all students to tackle humanityâ€™s most pressing problems by adopting a multidisciplinary mindset and focusing on sustainable outcomes. Over a two week period, Hack the Globe brings together the brightest and most passionate students from across the globe to change the way they see the world in order to create innovative solutions that apply classroom learnings to real-world applications". In addition to being interdisciplinary, my team was also diverse in educational levels, a mixture of undergraduates and graduate education. This was very interesting to me, and it also proved to be the most challenging aspect as the majority were undergraduate students. With respect to the competition, we chose a sustainable development issue - water scarcity- and created a minimum viable product along with a business proposal. Here is a link to our [mvp](https://github.com/maderaroja/HTG-2022-Green-Water). I appreciate being among the top 300 successful applicants out of a pool of 3000.

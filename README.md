## Hackathon Competitions
---
## [Banff International Research Station, Career & Innovation Hub (BIRS CIH) Hackathon](https://careerandinnovationhub.ca/data-science-2021/#hackathon)
  
[Banff International Research Station, Career & Innovation Hub (BIRS CIH)](https://careerandinnovationhub.ca/data-science-2021/#hackathon) Hackathon required participants to build a visualization dashboard over the course of 24hrs that provided insight into the Canadian and American legislative process. Their partner, [IOTO International](http://www.ioto.ca), provided APIs to access the political data on their website. The difficulty and interest of the competition lie within the restricted time frame to employ the APIs to fetch the data from IOTO International's website. My team worked cohesively together to achieve 2nd place! Here is a [link](https://github.com/maderaroja/BIRS_CIH_dashboard) to our solution.
  
## [Hack The Globe (HTG)](https://globalspark.world/?linkId=148571003#/hacktheglobe)  
  
[HTG](https://globalspark.world/?linkId=148571003#/hacktheglobe) required participants to build, over the course of 2 weeks, a business proposal and a minimum viable product (mvp) that deal with one of 12 areas of the UN sustainable Development Goals. My team and I chose water scarcity as our sustainable development issue. Here is a [link](https://github.com/maderaroja/HTG-2022-Green-Water) to our mvp. I appreciate being among the top 300 successful applicants out of a pool of 3000.
